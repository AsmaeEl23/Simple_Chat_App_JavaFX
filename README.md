<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I am excited to introduce my chat application, Asmae's chat,which utilizes Multi Threads Blocking IO for fast and efficient communication. This application provides a platform for sending and receiving text-based messages in real-time, and it's perfect for staying in touch with friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<p>You need just to connect using your username, and then write the message, choose the recipient from the list, then send the message. </p>

<p>I tried to make this chat using Multi Threads Blocking IO, I can use any other method with the same way.</p>
